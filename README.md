<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



As a student, I'm diving into web development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend magic. Python and Django are unlocking backend wizardry, while AWS offers cloud prowess. Armed with these skills, I'm crafting dynamic digital experiences, one line of code at a time.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Simply clone or fork the project from the branch you'll find more necessary to scrape from. You'll find the most work was done on the DJANGO branch.

### Prerequisites

This project utilized Python v3.12.1, make sure when you run this project you're at least running python v3.x.x
  ```sh
  (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/)
  ```

### Installation

Once the application has been pulled and assuming you're on the django branch, you can do the following:



1. Clone the repo
2. Install Pillow
  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow 
  ```
3.CD into proper directory to run the application
   ```sh
    cd ..\Web-Development-Pack\HTML - Pracitce\django\resume
   ```
4. Run the server
   ```sh
   python .\manage.py runserver
   ```
5. Please note, to utilize the admin panel (127.0.0.1:8000/admin you will need to generate your own super user account. Follow along with the directions below
   ```sh
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-superuser-in-django/
   ```
6. You should now be able to roam freely through the project and code base. Please keep in mind this is an active project that is subject to changes that may break at any time with 0 guarentee in X years time it'll work.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This code base at its core has the fundamental principles to become a very BASIC store front. However, it falls short on a number of different fronts which I may address over time.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Push out to github
- [x] Wrap up framework of website
- [ ] Clean-up the CSS, as it is a mess
- [ ] Remove extra NAV URLs, focus on turning the website into a portfolio website and not a store front.
- [ ] Add an active database for users which authenticated email, username, and password.
    - [ ] Add something more interactive and fun for recruiters, make it more pleasing to the eye.
    - [ ] Give a solid reason for signing up, whats the point besides testing it as a demo site? Perhaps even remove the signup process, but will need to consider how I want to store data or rapidly clean data to prevent an accumulation of spam.
- [ ] Address any security concerns I may have, if I do in fact host in AWS or somewhere I may be charged. Consider capping payment or only spinning up instance per request.
- [ ] Link to AWS, heroku, or some free dev app hosting website
